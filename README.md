WearOS todo list app for keeping your schedule straight

This app integrates with [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) to display your to-do items on your smartwatch. I created this app because Todoist's current smartwatch app requires you to use your phone to send tasks to your watch as notifications, and I thought it would be much more convenient if I could simply see the tasks in an app on my watch.

This app is not created by, affiliated with, or supported by Doist.
