WearOS app for keeping your schedule straight

This app integrates with [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) to display your to-do items on your smartwatch. I decided to create this app because Todoist's mobile app does not have an easy way to view these items without using a phone, and I thought it would be much more convenient if I could simply see them from my watch.
